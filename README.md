# IIAS

This repository contains the practical material for "Causal inference and target trial emulation". The example code and solutions are written in R, so it is most convenient to work with R and RStudio. However, we don't use any packages and the procedures are relatively simple, so you may prefer to implement the algorithms in your preferred language (e.g. Python).
